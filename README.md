# User Authentication System

## Overview

This is a user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their profile. The system includes a simple user management feature with the ability to store user information such as name, email, phone, profession, and password. 

The project uses **Express.js** as the backend framework and **MongoDB** for database storage.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their name, email, phone, profession, and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in using their email and password.
- **User Authentication**: Passwords are hashed for secure storage and comparison.
- **Session Management**: User sessions are managed through Express-session.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: bcrypt (for password hashing)
- **Sessions**: Express-session
- **Frontend**: EJS, Bootstrap

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. MongoDB running locally or use a cloud MongoDB service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
3. A code editor (like VSCode) to modify the files.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shabil15/User-Assignment.git
   cd user-assignment
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**:
   - If you're using **MongoDB locally**, ensure your MongoDB service is running.
   - If using **MongoDB Atlas**, replace the connection URI in your `config.js` file with your Atlas URI.

4. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
